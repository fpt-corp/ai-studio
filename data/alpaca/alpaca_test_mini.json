The '-it' option is a shorthand for '--interactive --tty', which instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY and attach to stdin, stdout, and stderr.\n\nOnce you run this command, you should be attached to the container's command prompt and can interact with it as if you were using a shell directly on the container. To detach from the container's pipes and leave the container running in the background, you can use the keyboard shortcut 'CTRL-p CTRL-q'.\n\nI hope this helps!

        "instruction": "In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \"yes\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \"no\".\nExample: Review: For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny! Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer. The Moroni character is an absolute scream. Watch for Alan The Skipper Hale jr. as a police Sgt. Question: is it a positive review?\nExample solution: yes\nExample explanation: There is an expression of appreciation in this movie review, hence we can say it's positive. So generated label is 'yes'.\n\nProblem: Review: I wish more movies were two hours long. On the other hand, I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long. \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Gettysburg\" - that's about the length I've come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even \"Gettysburg\" lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.By contrast Ang Lee's film is bloated and uneventful. It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours. That wasn't a compliment. It's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation: at the time it feels as though it will never end, afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.The film gets off on the wrong foot, as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage (bad mistake) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe. The central two are Jake, the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln, and Jack, an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares. (I had to re-read that sentence to make sure I hadn't written \"Jack\" instead of \"Jake\" at some point or vice versa.) The two go off to become \"bushwhackers\" - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official Southern army, which I presume they think is for sissies. I'm afraid Lee lost me right there. It's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes: if we have some independent reason to like them, or feel as if we know them in some way, then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more. Not so here. We aren't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour; when we are, it becomes clear he's a gormless pimple of a man, who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does, whose psychology is purely immitative. The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way. I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen. I thought: good - kill the rebels, end the damned war, let me go home.Aggravating this problem is the horrible, horrible dialogue. Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent. I've heard accents from all over the English-speaking world and this is the worst of them all. I don't care if Southerners really did talk like that, it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours. And believe me, we do listen to it for the full two hours: Lee's picture is a talky one, largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical, say-everything-three-times, folksy drawl. It would help if they talked faster, but not much. Can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?In short: the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life, who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech, who don't bathe often enough, to whom nothing of interest happens, despite their being involved in a war. Good points? Jewel was nice to look at, and so was the scenery. But I have complaints even here. The cinematography, nicely framed, looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for Jewel, we were teased with her body, but never actually allowed to gaze upon it, which I think is the least we were owed.

Since you have to hand wash, I always have to be extra careful.The next thing is the plunger. I realize the fit has to be tight, but here again I would point to the rim of the cup. It is not tapered enough for my wife to get the plunger in the cup very easily without breaking the edges of the plunger or spilling the hot contents. She already tore up one of the teeth on the plunger. Fortunately the wire spring in the plunger and the teeth themselves are decently built.I find I have to put the plunger in sideways and then fiddle with it while it sits to get the lid on.I think this is a nice start, but if I need another one, especially considering the price, I would probably go back to a glass press.\nAns: dissatisfied\n\n(Q).\nHere is a review left by a customer on a product.

Neither of us can figure out exactly what went wrong, but a tiny piece of staple is so seriously lodged into the slot that we can't get it out. We've tried pliers and tweezers. Perhaps a coat hanger? Honestly, the location is so tiny that probably only another staple would actually be able to get in there, and who could properly wield a staple with enough force to push the darn thing out?

With GTM, you can manage all of your website tags from a single interface, making it easier to deploy and manage tags on your website. Here are some things you should know when you start working with GTM:\n\n1. GTM works by adding a small piece of JavaScript code, known as the GTM container, to your website. This container is used to hold all of your tags, triggers, and variables.\n2. GTM allows you to create and manage tags, which are small snippets of code that perform specific functions on your website. For example, you can use a tag to track pageviews, add a Facebook pixel, or send data to Google Analytics.\n3. GTM also lets you create triggers, which are used to control when a tag is fired. Triggers can be based on events, such as a user clicking a button, or on specific conditions, such as a user visiting a specific page.\n4. GTM includes a wide range of variables that you can use to customize your tags and triggers. For example, you can use a variable to dynamically insert the current page URL into a tag, or to capture the value of a form field.\n5. GTM has a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily create and manage your tags, triggers, and variables. You can preview your changes in real-time and test them before publishing them to your live website.\n6. GTM integrates with a wide range of third-party tools and services, such as Google Analytics, AdWords, and Facebook, making it easy to use these tools on your website.\n\nI hope this information is helpful! If you have any further questions about working with GTM, feel free to ask."

We identify several novel mutated genes as well as complex rearrangements of signature receptors, including EGFR and PDGFRA. TERT promoter mutations are shown to correlate with elevated mRNA expression, supporting a role in telomerase reactivation. Correlative analyses confirm that the survival advantage of the proneural subtype is conferred by the G-CIMP phenotype, and MGMT DNA methylation may be a predictive biomarker for treatment response only in classical subtype GBM. Integrative analysis of genomic and proteomic profiles challenges the notion of therapeutic inhibition of a pathway as an alternative to inhibition of the target itself. These data will facilitate the discovery of therapeutic and diagnostic target candidates, the validation of research and clinical observations and the generation of unanticipated hypotheses that can advance our molecular understanding of this lethal cancer..

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A computing system that is inspired by the biological neural networks that make up animal brains. ANNs are composed of several layers of interconnected nodes, where each layer processes information and passes it on to the next.\n\n2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A type of ANN that is designed for image recognition and classification. CNNs have multiple layers that are specialized to detect and recognize different features, such as edges or corners, in the input images.\n\n3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): A type of ANN designed to process sequential data, such as text or time series. RNNs have a looping mechanism that allows them to retain information from previous time steps, making them well-suited for tasks such as language translation and speech recognition.\n\n4. Deep Belief Networks (DBN): A type of generative model composed of multiple layers of stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), which are trained in an unsupervised manner. DBNs can be used for tasks such as feature extraction, representation learning, and dimensionality reduction.\n\n5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): A type of neural network architecture where two neural networks, called the generator and the discriminator, are trained simultaneously to learn a data distribution. The generator produces fake data samples, while the discriminator determines if the generated data is real or fake. GANs can be used for tasks such as data generation, image synthesis, and style transfer."
