In the 1960s, the USACE predicted an increase to 12 million short tons (11 Mt) per year by 2000, but instead the opposite has happened. The amount of goods plunged from 3.3 million short tons (3.0 Mt) in 1977 to just 1.3 million short tons (1.2 Mt) in 2000. One of the largest drops has been in agricultural products, especially wheat. Part of the reason is that irrigated land along the Missouri has only been developed to a fraction of its potential. In 2006, barges on the Missouri hauled only 200,000 short tons (180,000 t) of products which is equal to the amount of daily freight traffic on the Mississippi.\nQuestion: is there barge traffic on the missouri river\nOutput:",

The first half of the book is whimsical, getting to know the characters and their foibles. The second half of the book is almost solely an inspector interviewing each character about the events in the first half of the book. Equally annoying is that the solution is very easy (I knew as soon as they found the 'unfinished clue' who it would be) and at the same time, the reader isn't given the data to confirm the solution until the unveiling of the murderer. I would definitely recommend reading a different Heyer mystery.

        "instruction": "CHAPTER FIVE\n RULE #1\n Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\n From Jeremy\nNow we are down to the nuts and bolts of what I do for my patients in the office and what I am going to do for you in this book. For convenience, we call it the “James Protocol” or just the “Protocol”; either is fine. And to give it some structure and make it easier to follow, we have boiled it down to Seven Rules. Think of them as seven paths to freedom from back pain, if you like, but the point is that there are seven of them and they are the main markers on your path to an end of pain. \nRule #1: Stop Doing Dumb Stuff\nI like this rule because it is so obvious. And so important. Virtually all of us with back pain are doing one or more dumb things that trigger that pain. Not because we are thick. I have dealt with some of the smartest people in the country, and they are as susceptible to these errors as anyone else. The problem is that we just have not been alerted to the problems. Or we have fallen into them so gradually that we never noticed. \nBy the way, this is not the beginning of what you might think of as the Big Fix—the fundamental changes that are going to make a permanent difference. But you cannot turn to that before you make the darned pain go away. Rule #1 is to make the pain go away by the simple step of ceasing to do the stuff that immediately causes it. As obvious as that sounds, an awful lot of healers and sufferers haven’t latched on to this. \nHow do you recognize the behaviors that hurt your back or trigger back pain? From long experience, I have learned most people know, at some level, what they are doing wrong. Their first response is apt to be wrong, though. At first, they’ll want to tell you about some particular incident. “I rolled over in bed funny.” “I bent over to retie my shoe.” “I took a long flight (or whatever).” It’s interesting: Almost everyone thinks that the little event is the dreadful thing that “did it.” In fact, that is rarely the case. \nBut their second response is better. If you dig a little, what you eventually hear about is patterns of behavior that have lasted years, decades in fact, that are almost certainly the real cause of the pain. The most obvious one, which we come back to again and again because it is so important to so many: “I’ve been curled up over my computer a lot lately.” Another popular one: “It crops up after I play golf (tennis, bowling, or whatever).” Or: “It’s worse after strength training.” Or yoga, or whatever. So, it is not moving “funny” one time in the night. It is moving funny—often in the same way—for decades. Which makes it more obvious, when you think about it. And a bit more difficult to change.\nI listen carefully to these stories and I am very interested indeed in these particular causes. But I confess that I have been at this so long and have known “the enemy” for so long that I take what may seem like a surprisingly broad-brush approach. I know the behaviors that have caused the greatest problems for almost all my patients and I now take the simple approach of telling everyone to stop all of them. At least in the first instance. There will be time to sort out particular problems (and get you back into particular activities) later on. But for now, I urge you to stop doing all the following: \n• Sitting for hours at your computer (details to follow)\n• Yoga\n• Downhill skiing or snowboarding\n• All strength training (whether with weights or not)\n• Golf \n• Snowmobiling \n• Tennis or other racquet sports\n• Uphill hiking\n• Pilates (yes, Pilates)\n• Horseback riding\n• Running\n• Cycling\n• Prolonged sitting—in the car, a plane, or wherever.\n• Anything else that involves bending, twisting, pounding, or otherwise pressuring your back\nYou may be shocked by this list but don’t worry. We’ll have you back to most of these activities pretty soon. And back to all of them, eventually, but with modified movements that don’t hurt your back. Admittedly, this is a pretty serious first step, but back pain is a pretty serious affliction, as you know. \nSITTING FOR HOURS AT YOUR COMPUTER\nThe most serious of these “stop being dumb” problems—and the hardest to address—is sitting for hours at your computer. You will say you simply can’t stop that. It’s your job, it’s what you do for a living, it’s your life, and so on. All right, I surely understand that: It’s what slapped me on my back, in agony, not too long ago. Working at the computer was my life, too, but it almost put an end to my career. \nSo let’s address that one first, the irresistible business of sitting for hours at your computer. The first fix—and it won’t be easy at first—is just to get up every twenty or thirty minutes and move around. That alone will do wonders. Do that religiously, and you can continue to use your computer. \nFolks tell me that they cannot get up that often. They will lose their train of thought, they will get jumpy and weird . . . they just can’t do it. Well, yes, they can. And they have to, because continuing to do what you do is not working for you. So just plain do it. Get up. Change your position. Do some stretches. Go chat with someone. Do anything. In my experience, your concentration will be better, not worse, once you get slightly used to it. Whether or not that turns out to be true for you, just do it. It is a critical first step for many, many of you.\nSOME OTHER TRICKS\nIt may help to get a standing desk. But please bear in mind that it is not the standing that is the answer, it’s the movement. You are more apt to move around if you work at a standing desk, which is good. But make no mistake: It is just as bad to stand in one position all day as to sit in one position all day. Movement and change are the answers, not buying a standing desk. Some people get so serious about this that they buy “treadmill desks,” so you are actually walking (very slowly) as you work. I haven’t tried it. \nThe same goes for sitting on a big exercise ball. That, per se, doesn’t do much good (indeed, your posture may get worse, which is disastrous). But you are more likely to move, on the ball. Try it if it appeals to you. \nThe most obvious (and effective) thing to do is to just get up and walk around for a moment or two, every half hour or so. Another solution, just change the way you’re sitting from time to time. I hate to say this but, if your posture is pretty good, hunch forward for a few minutes, once in a while. Be “bad.” If your posture is lousy, by all means make it good, and use good posture most of the time. But any movement is good, including the occasional slouch. It’s movement that matters, any movement. Cross your knees, from time to time. Hold your legs out straight and tense your muscles as hard as you can, and hold for 20 seconds. It feels good and it works. Lean back, opening up the front of your hip, bend forward without rounding your back. Jiggle one foot. Any silly excuse to move will do. But move. \nWhy is movement so critical? Because it is an answer to “creep,” and creep is serious business. \nCreep\nCreep sounds bad, and it is. Creep refers to the fact that your body can actually become deformed in a surprisingly short time, by your rotten (static) behavior. Put parts of your body under stresses that they were not designed to bear for a stretch of time, and a bad thing happens: They deform. If you subject the tissues in your back to “static flexion,” from prolonged sitting, the tissues in your back start to deform and stretch, causing instability in the spine. This puts the harmful loads directly through the discs and joints. The same with “repetitive flexion,” which means bending over again and again, at some repetitive task. (Think gardening, or improper weightlifting.) Again, the muscles and other tissues that normally protect the spine become lax and deformed, causing immediate pain and long-term damage. This also sets you up for potential disaster when you stand. Your spine is now unstable and subject to serious damage if you were to lift something heavy before the tissues return to their normal state. This can have even more serious, permanent results. That’s creep, and it is not good.",

        "input": "",
        "output": "An investment board is a key component of any charter city, as it plays a crucial role in attracting and managing investments that help drive the city's economic growth and development. The Economic Development Board (EDB) of Singapore serves as a prime example of the importance of an investment board in a charter city.\n\nThe EDB was established in 1961 as a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, with the mandate to promote and enhance Singapore's economic development. Over the years, the EDB has played a central role in shaping Singapore's economic policies and attracting foreign investments to the country.\n\nOne of the main functions of the EDB is to identify and pursue investment opportunities that align with Singapore's economic strategies and development goals. This includes identifying key sectors for growth, such as advanced manufacturing, clean technology, and digital services, and working with potential investors to bring their projects to fruition.\n\nThe EDB also plays a key role in supporting the growth and development of local businesses, particularly in the early stages of their development. This includes providing assistance with market research, access to financing, and networking opportunities.\n\nIn addition to its investment promotion and development activities, the EDB also works closely with other government agencies and stakeholders to ensure that Singapore's business environment is conducive to growth and innovation. This includes working to maintain a stable and predictable regulatory environment, as well as ensuring that the country has a skilled and talented workforce.\n\nThere are several key reasons why an investment board like the EDB is essential for a charter city.\n\nFirst and foremost, an investment board helps to attract foreign investments to the city, which can drive economic growth and development. By identifying and pursuing investment opportunities that align with the city's economic strategies, an investment board can help to bring in much-needed capital and expertise that can help to drive innovation and growth.\n\nIn addition, an investment board can help to support the growth and development of local businesses, particularly in the early stages of their development. This can be especially important in a charter city, where the business environment may be less established and more uncertain. By providing assistance with market research, access to financing, and networking opportunities, an investment board can help to nurture and support the growth of local businesses.\n\nAnother key role of an investment board is to work closely with other government agencies and stakeholders to ensure that the business environment is conducive to growth and innovation. This includes maintaining a stable and predictable regulatory environment, as well as ensuring that the city has a skilled and talented workforce. By working to create an environment that is conducive to business growth, an investment board can help to attract and retain top talent and investment.\n\nIn summary, an investment board like the EDB is a crucial component of a charter city, as it plays a central role in attracting and managing investments that drive economic growth and development. By identifying and pursuing investment opportunities, supporting local businesses, and working to create a supportive business environment, an investment board can help to drive innovation and growth in a charter city."

Stride scheduling aims to sequentially allocate a resource for the duration of standard time-slices (quantum) in a fashion, that performs periodic recurrences of allocations.

Here is a sample script that you can use to enable keyboard input for movement, ducking, and jumping in a 2D platformer game in Unity:\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;\n    [SerializeField] private float jumpForce = 10f;\n\n    private Rigidbody2D rb;\n\n    private bool isGrounded = true;\n\n    private void Start()\n    {\n        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();\n    }\n\n    private void Update()\n    {\n        // Handle horizontal movement\n        float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxisRaw(\"Horizontal\");\n        float xVelocity = horizontalInput * moveSpeed;\n        rb.velocity = new Vector2(xVelocity, rb.velocity.y);\n\n        // Handle jumping\n        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && isGrounded)\n        {\n            rb.AddForce(Vector2.up * jumpForce, ForceMode2D.Impulse);\n            isGrounded = false;\n        }\n\n        // Handle ducking\n        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.DownArrow))\n        {\n            // Your code for ducking goes here\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)\n    {\n        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag(\"Ground\"))\n        {\n            isGrounded = true;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of what this script does:\n\n1. The `moveSpeed` and `jumpForce` variables are public so you can adjust them in the Inspector. They control how fast the player moves horizontally and how high they jump.\n2. In the `Start()` method, we get a reference to the player's `Rigidbody2D` component.\n3. In the `Update()` method, we handle keyboard input for left/right movement and jumping. When the player presses the left or right arrow keys, the script sets the player's horizontal velocity accordingly. When the player presses the space key and is currently grounded, the script adds a vertical impulse to the player's rigidbody to make them jump.\n4. In the `OnCollisionEnter2D()` method, we detect when the player touches the ground and set the `isGrounded` flag accordingly.\n5. Finally, there is a placeholder for ducking code, which you can fill in with your own implementation.\n\nNote that this is just a sample script and you may need to modify it to fit your specific game requirements."

Title: Best design so far! Review: I've owned many coffee makers in my time, but this is the best by far. The simple, well thought-out yet attractive design has a small footprint on your counter top. All the annoying features of other coffee makers seem to have been eliminated. It is one of the few products that are worth every penny, even at the full retail price.One of my favorite features is the mid-brew stop-and-pour. Unlike most other coffee makers, this one does not release the stopper mechanism till the carafe is replaced in the brewing position, eliminating ANY drip. Additionally, the carafe lid is easy to remove and pours without any spilling...something Krupp has yet to overcome with their carafe designs.Ignore any negative points made by others.

Title: Live still cannot match the 2k games Review: I rented both of the different basketball games within a week of each other. The ESPN (2k) was by far a better all around game. Live lacks any sort of defensive presence. Scoring is way to easy. They attempted to create a 1 on 1 mode, but espn's is a street mode which you can do anything from 1on1 to 5on5. They finally included a dynasty mode, but no owner mode like in madden. I did not even try to clear room on my memory card to have a team when I bought the game. Espn is still the best. The 24/7 mode keeps the game interesting. It allows you to not only improve a player, but also have fun making yourself a better player.

In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \"Flipper\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.[7] Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \"Keep Out\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local Japanese government officials are involved in the hiding of the hunting, and the Japanese public is not fully aware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat. The film states that the dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury and interviews two local...???\noutput answer: The Cove\n\ninput question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1979, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) of Lillian, Ohio, and his 14-year-old[3] son Joe (Joel Courtney), mourn the death of his mother Elizabeth (Caitriona Balfe) in a steel mill accident.[4] Jack blames her co-worker, Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard), as she was covering his shift while he recovered from a hangover, and all Joe has left is a locket that belonged to her, that he now holds on to. Four months later, Joe's best friend Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) decides to make a low-budget zombie movie for an international film competition. Charles enlists the help of Preston Scott (Zach Mills), Martin Read (Gabriel Basso), and Cary McCarthy (Ryan Lee), as well as Dainard's daughter, Alice (Elle Fanning). Though their fathers would be furious, Joe and Alice become infatuated with each other. Charles has them film a scene at a train depot at midnight. While they are rehearsing, a train approaches, and Charles has them start filming as the train passes to add 'production value'. While filming, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train, causing a massive derailment that destroys the train, the depot and the surrounding area, and the friends barely survive. The children investigate the wreck and find crates full of strange white cubes, then discover the truck's driver is Dr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), their biology teacher. Woodward, barely alive, warns them at gunpoint to forget what they saw that night, or else they and their parents will be killed. The children flee the scene just as a convoy from the local U.S. Air Force base, led by Col. Nelec (Noah Emmerich), arrive at the scene. Nelec discovers an empty Super 8mm film box, and assumes the event was purposely captured on camera. While Joe and Charles wait for their film to be developed, the town experiences strange events: All the dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates and electronic items from all over are stolen. Overhearing military communications, Jack approaches Nelec to address...???\noutput answer: Super 8\n\ninput question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie involves several interconnected stories that converge at 11:14 p.m. The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding flashbacks:Jack (Henry Thomas), who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone. The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m. Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road. He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car. When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight. The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma (Barbara Hershey), assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it's no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she 'never uses' and because she is friends with the chief of police. Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines. When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car. He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him. Officer Hannagan (Clark Gregg) speaks with Jack, and noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test. Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers. When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence. Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded. When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the 2 people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy (Shawn Hatosy) and Buzzy (Hilary Swank), to move over so that Jack will fit. While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull his pocketknife out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape.

The Aquarion is also equipped with a pair of powerful, webbed front legs, and a long, elegant tail which it uses to gracefully propel itself through the water.\n\nIn some mythologies, the Aquarion is said to possess the ability to control the tides and currents, using its magical horn to summon powerful underwater vortexes to sweep its enemies away. It is also said that the Aquarion is fiercely protective of its underwater realm, and will fiercely defend it from any intruders.\n\nDespite their intimidating appearances, however, Aquarions are also believed to be gentle and benevolent creatures, and tales are told of sailors and fishermen who were saved from drowning by the powerful embrace of an Aquarion's webbed limbs. Some myths even claim that the tears of an Aquarion can heal wounds and sicknesses, making these creatures highly sought after by both heroes and villains alike."

We know Paul would get twice the reward of a B + if he gets an A. This means 2 * $5 = $10 for every A. However, we know his reward for every A could be (2x) doubled if he obtains at least two A + . This means 2 * $10 = $20 for every A if Paul gets at least two A + . We learn here then that Paul will get a higher reward for obtaining A grades ($20) than getting A + grades ($15) as long as he's able to score at least two A + . To maximize his payout, Paul will need to get only (2) two A + from his 10 courses. Therefore he should aim to get an A in the remaining 10 - 2 = 8 courses.

Originally listed for $47.4 million in the summer of 2008, the property is now scheduled for a July auction with a reserve price, or low estimate, of $15 million.\n\nThe owner, a Houston investor, bought the property in 2004 intending to use it as a family retreat, says listing agent Richard Lewis of Sotheby’s International Realty, which is selling the property with Concierge Auctions.\n\nThe owner and his family are instead spending most of their time at a large horse ranch outside Washington, D.C. purchased several years ago. “It makes no sense for them to have such a huge asset and never be here,” Mr. Lewis says.\n\nThe ranch comes with quite a pedigree: It was owned in the early 1900s by the Abercrombie family now known for the upscale teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, according to a spokeswoman for Concierge Auctions. A subsequent owner operated the ranch for decades as a summer camp for children, including scions of the Rockefeller, Kennedy and DuPont families, Concierge says; the camp continues to operate today from another location.\n\nThe property can be purchased in its entirety or as one of two lots, one with a reserve of $11 million and the other, with a reserve of $4 million. The more expensive parcel is about 52 acres and has a more than 10,000-square-foot stone residence the owner was building for his family. It is is 90% complete, Mr. Lewis says, allowing the buyer to choose some of the finishes. The two-story mansion has floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Teton mountain range, several fireplaces and about a half-mile of frontage on Gros Ventre River, a tributary of the Snake River. Items including doors and stained glass windows were sourced from European castles and churches; a stone staircase was taken out of a castle’s turret. A three-acre lake with a 70-degree, year-round temperature is adjacent to the home and can be used for swimming. The parcel also has a recently renovated log-cabin guest house with two bedrooms, a fireplace and a kitchen.\n\nThe other lot has a quarter-mile of river frontage. There’s a 1,700-square-foot building currently used as the caretaker’s home and two log cabins that could be used for guests. There’s also a barn that Mr. Lewis said has appeared in Marlboro commercials.\n\nThe lots will first be auctioned off individually, then collectively, with the lots selling for the highest collective price over the reserve. The auction is open to registered bidders and their agents and is scheduled for July 16 at 11 a.m. on the Kelly, Wyo. property. Telephone bids also will be accepted.\nWhat was this article about?\nA:\nFormerly owned by the Abercrombie family, Teton Valley Ranch, once listed at $45 million, is scheduled for auction with a $15 million reserve in July.\nQ:\nLondon burns again for 350th anniversary of Great Fire\nThe City of London has commemorated the anniversary of the blaze which razed it to the ground 350 years ago by safely reliving the destruction on a much smaller scale.\n\nWhich isn't to say the doomed reconstruction of the city in 1666, which was torched overnight, was anything to sniff at.\n\nThe 120m-long wooden model was designed by US \"burn artist\" David Best and was reduced to ashes on a barge moored on the Thames.\n\nBaked goods were blamed for starting the original blaze, which over the course of four days destroyed some 13,200 homes, 87 churches and a cathedral.\n\nAbout 80 per cent of the city was left in ruins and some 70,000 people left without homes.\n\nRemarkably only six deaths were recorded as a result of the fire, over which a French watchmaker was hanged after he falsely claimed responsibility.\n\n\"Three-hundred and fifty years ago, when embers from a baker's oven sparked one of the most catastrophic events the capital has ever witnessed, London's economic prowess almost came to a fiery end,\" the ABC quotes Nick Bodger, head of cultural and visitor development for the City of London, as saying ahead of the event.\n\n\"A renewed sense of purpose saw the great city we enjoy today rise from those ashes, develop and thrive.\"\n\nThousands turned out to watch the reconstruction, which wrapped up a commemorative festival that began late last week.\n\n© Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016\nWhat was this article about?\nA:",

There are other foster children in her home as well as Peg and John's own children. At one point, she attends a circus, where she meets Madame Adeline, whom she believes to be her mother because of her bright red hair, which is similar to Hetty's own. A few weeks later, the time comes for Hetty and Gideon to be sent back to the Foundling Hospital. Everyone in the family is devastated, and Jem and Hetty promise to find each other again. Hetty finds her time in the hospital miserable and oppressive, and often rebels or otherwise talks back in an environment where she's expected to be meek and obedient.

After Colby does so he tells his girlfriend, the unscrupulous mob-connected showgirl Flaxy Martin, that he wants to quit the organization and become respectable. Meanwhile, the syndicate arranges for Peggy Farrar to falsely testify on behalf of Caesar.  After Caesar is cleared of the charges, however, she changes her mind.  Flaxy and Caesar go visit Peggy at her apartment to force her into silence, and Caesar ends up killing her. Due to circumstantial evidence, Flaxy is suspected of murdering Peggy. Not realizing her involvement in the killing, Colby tells the police that he did it, his plan being to defend himself so well that he gets both himself and Flaxy off.  Unfortunately, Flaxy and Hap Richie set him up during the trial and Colby is sentenced for Peggy's murder. As Colby awaits transportation to prison, Sam Malko, a friend of Colby and a former client, tells him that Caesar had been getting drunk and bragging that Colby was sentenced for a killing (the murder of Peggy) that he (Caesar) committed. Sam wonders why Flaxy was not helping Colby since she must know the same information. On his way to prison to serve 20 years, Colby escapes and when he gets to the highway he passes out in front of motorist Nora Carson.  Nora helps Colby get to the city to find out how he was framed.

Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \"haunting presence\" and \"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who \"is the manifestation of the Canadian character,\" according to a Group of Seven member?, what is it ?\nAns: Thomson\n\nThis article: Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hangs up. Randy mockingly dresses up as a clown, disbelieving of Casey's claims that clowns are inside the house. His plan to jump out at Geoffrey and Casey is cut short after he is stabbed by one of the clowns. Geoffrey manages to kill the first clown by hitting him with a wooden plank, knocking him down a flight of stairs and breaking his neck. contains an answer for the question: What are the first names of the people who are left alone when their mother visits relatives?, what is it ?",

A versatile and well-rounded attacker, from a tactical standpoint, Ibrahimović is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to both create and score goals for his team, although he is most often deployed as a striker, due to his composure and eye for goal. He has also functioned in a more creative playmaking role at times, as a supporting forward or even as a number 10, in particular in his later career, after losing some of his pace and stamina with age; this deeper position allows him to drop into midfield to pick up the ball, where he can utilize his technical ability, vision, passing, and movement to create space and provide assists for teammates. While naturally right-footed, Ibrahimović is a powerful and accurate striker of the ball from both inside or outside the penalty area with either foot, and is also known for his accuracy from penalties and dead ball situations. An accurate finisher with his head as well as with his feet, his height, elevation, and strength often give him an advantage at winning aerial challenges, and also allow him to function as a \"target man\"; despite his large stature, Ibrahimović is uncommonly agile for a player of his size, and his athleticism and ability in the air have seen him score several goals from acrobatic strikes and volleys throughout his career, which earned him the moniker Ibracadabra in the Italian media. In spite of his size and physique, Ibrahimović possesses excellent technique and ball control, which, coupled with his balance, power, and physicality, enables him to hold up the ball well with his back to goal, retain possession, and link up with other players; he has also been praised by pundits for his creativity and dribbling skills. Although he is not gifted with exceptional pace, in particular over shorter distances, which became more evident in his later career as he slowed down with age, he is also a quick player and a fast sprinter, who possessed significant acceleration in his youth, and was able to clock top speeds over 30 km/h even into his 30s."

For example, data science can be used to predict the stock market or to find out what people want to buy. It can also be used to detect diseases earlier than before."

        "output": "This is the source code for a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer that implements Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing (COBS). COBS is a method of encoding binary data to ensure that the encoded data does not contain any byte values of zero (null bytes), which can cause issues in transmission and storage.\n\nThe COBS FIFO buffer provided in this code allows data to be pushed onto the buffer one byte at a time or in bulk, and it allows data to be popped off the buffer one byte at a time or in bulk. The COBS encoding and decoding is handled internally by the push\\_frame() and pop\\_frame() functions, which encode and decode complete frames of data rather than individual bytes.\n\nThe functions defined in this code are:\n\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_init(): initializes the FIFO buffer by allocating memory for the buffer and setting its head, tail, and count values to zero. It also creates a mutex lock to ensure thread-safety when accessing the buffer.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_deinit(): frees the memory allocated for the FIFO buffer and destroys the mutex lock.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_push(): adds a single byte of data to the end of the buffer. If the buffer is full, an error is returned.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_pop(): removes a single byte of data from the front of the buffer. If the buffer is empty, an error is returned.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_push\\_buf(): adds a block of data to the end of the buffer by calling cobs\\_fifo\\_push() for each byte in the block.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_pop\\_buf(): removes a block of data from the front of the buffer by calling cobs\\_fifo\\_pop() for each byte in the block.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_push\\_frame(): encodes a frame of data using COBS and adds it to the end of the buffer. If the buffer does not have enough space for the encoded data, an error is returned.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_pop\\_frame(): decodes a frame of data from the front of the buffer using COBS and returns the length of the decoded data. If there are no frames in the buffer, 0 is returned.\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_find\\_next\\_len(): finds the length of the next frame in the buffer, based on the position of the next null byte (which marks the end of the current frame). This function is used internally by cobs\\_fifo\\_pop\\_frame().\n* cobs\\_fifo\\_get\\_next\\_len(): returns the length of the next frame in the buffer, without modifying the buffer or its internal state.\n\nNote that this code depends on another file, \"cobs.h\", which likely contains the COBS encoding and decoding functions used in this code."

Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for transmitting and receiving raw bit streams over a physical medium. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications for the physical medium used to transmit the data.\n2. Data Link Layer: The data link layer provides reliable transfer of data across a physical link by detecting and correcting errors that may occur during transmission. It also manages access to the physical medium and controls the flow of data.\n3. Network Layer: The network layer is responsible for the delivery of data between different networks. It determines the best path for data transmission and provides services such as routing and addressing.\n4. Transport Layer: The transport layer ensures the reliable transmission of data between end systems. It is responsible for establishing and maintaining end-to-end connections, providing error detection and recovery, and controlling the flow of data.\n5. Session Layer: The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It also provides services such as synchronization and checkpointing.\n6. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for the representation of data to the application layer. It performs tasks such as data compression, encryption, and decryption.\n7. Application Layer: The application layer provides services to applications and end users. It supports functions such as email, file transfer, and remote login.\n\nThe ISO-OSI model is a conceptual framework that helps network designers and engineers understand the interactions between different layers of communication systems. It provides a clear separation of responsibilities and helps ensure that different components of a communication system can work together seamlessly."

Each player marks their move on a 3x3 grid, with the goal to make a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of their symbol. Below is an example algorithm for playing tic-tac-toe in Python:\n\n1. Initialization: initialize the board as a 3x3 grid, with all its cell empty, represented by spaces(\" \").\n```python\nboard = [\n    [\" \", \" \", \" \"],\n    [\" \", \" \", \" \"],\n    [\" \", \" \", \" \"]\n]\n```\n2. Display the board: create a function to display the current state of the board.\n```python\ndef display_board(board):\n    for row in board:\n        print(\"|\" + \"|\".join(row) + \"|\")\n```\n3. Player's move: create a function to make a move, the function should take the player's symbol, and the position of the move as input, and update the board accordingly. The position of the move can be represented as a tuple of row and column.\n```python\ndef make_move(symbol, position, board):\n    row, col = position\n    if board[row][col] == \" \":\n        board[row][col] = symbol\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n``` \n4. Check for win: create a function to check if a player has won the game. A player wins when they have their symbol in a row, column, or diagonal. \n```python\ndef has_winner(board):\n    # check rows\n    for row in board:\n        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] and row[0] != \" \":\n            return row[0]\n    # check columns\n    for col in range(3):\n        if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == board[2][col] and board[0][col] != \" \":\n            return board[0][col]\n    # check diagonals\n    if board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] and board[0][0] != \" \":\n        return board[0][0]\n    if board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0] and board[0][2"

After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios â such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth the head of Mammoth Studios, and Flanagan the film's director, is giving an interview, getting the animals blame and fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to leave for home, Cranston, Frances, and T.W. blame him for ruining their careers while Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny.

Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and the two find themselves in the \"war-zone\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two suspicious black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire placed purposely in the middle of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and putting him in a coma. The two drive away and decide not to report the accident to the police. Meanwhile, indigent alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman), almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlady of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment...\n****\n[A]: What is Sherman propelled into ?\n\n\n[Q]: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a much-admired high school history teacher living in the suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska, who is actively involved in many after-school activities, one of which is overseeing the student government election process. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving junior with an insufferable air of self-importance. Earlier in the year, another teacher, Jim's best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) was fired from his job and divorced by his wife, Linda (Delaney Driscoll) after it came out that he and Tracy were having a sexual affair, while Tracy's reputation was unscathed. Against this backdrop, Tracy announces that she is running for student council president. Initially she is unopposed, as she is widely seen as the natural candidate for the job. When Tracy presents Mr. McAllister with her list of nominating signatures to qualify for the election ballot, she makes a remark about \"working closely\" together that he interprets as an indication she may try to seduce him. Perhaps annoyed by Tracy's presumptuousness, and/or concerned that he might give in to this seduction and share the same fate as his friend Dave, Mr. McAllister decides to persuade junior Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a slow-witted, but affable and popular football player to enter the race. Paul is unable to play football as he is recovering from a ski injury that resulted in his left leg being broken, and Mr. McAllister suggests a new way to explore his talents through student council. Although Paul is ambivalent at first, he agrees to run, much to Tracy's consternation. Meanwhile, Paul's adopted younger sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is rejected by her romantic interest Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia), who dismisses their time together as \"experimenting.\" Lisa then engages in a passionate relationship with Paul. In retaliation, Tammy decides to run for school president as well.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Learning to count in different languages is a useful skill to have for a variety of reasons. Not only can it help you to better understand the culture and customs of the countries where these languages are spoken, but it can also come in handy when traveling or doing business in those places. In this blog post, we will take a look at how to count from 1 to 10 in Spanish and French, two of the most widely spoken languages in the world.\n\nIn Spanish, the numbers from 1 to 10 are as follows:\n\n1. Uno\n2. Dos\n3. Tres\n4. Cuatro\n5. Cinco\n6. Seis\n7. Siete\n8. Ocho\n9. Nueve\n10. Diez\n\nAs you can see, the numbers in Spanish are relatively easy to learn and pronounce. The numbers 1 through 4 follow a similar pattern, with the ending \"-o\" being added to the corresponding cardinal numbers (un, dos, tres, cuatro). The numbers 5 through 9 also follow a similar pattern, with the ending \"-e\" being added to the corresponding cardinal numbers (cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve). The number 10 simply adds the ending \"-e\" to the cardinal number diez (dé).\n\nIn French, the numbers from 1 to 10 are as follows:\n\n1. Un\n2. Deux\n3. Trois\n4. Quatre\n5. Cinq\n6. Six\n7. Sept\n8. Huit\n9. Neuf\n10. Dix\n\nAs you can see, the numbers in French are also relatively easy to learn and pronounce. The numbers 1 through 4 follow a similar pattern, with the ending \"-e\" being added to the corresponding cardinal numbers (un, deux, trois, quatre). The numbers 5 through 9 also follow a similar pattern, with the ending \"-e\" being added to the corresponding cardinal numbers (cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf). The number 10 simply adds the ending \"-e\" to the cardinal number dix.\n\nKnowing how to count in Spanish and French can be particularly useful when traveling to countries where these languages are spoken. For example, if you are traveling to Spain, you can use your knowledge of Spanish numbers to navigate the streets, read signs, and understand menus at restaurants. Similarly, if you are traveling to France, you can use your knowledge of French numbers to communicate with locals, understand train schedules, and shop at stores.\n\nIn addition to being useful for travel, knowing how to count in different languages can also be helpful for doing business in those countries. For example, if you are working with a company based in Spain or France, being able to count in the local language can help you to better understand their business practices and communicate with your colleagues more effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, learning to count in different languages is a useful skill to have for a variety of reasons. It can help you to better understand the culture and customs of the countries where these languages are spoken, and it can come in handy when traveling or doing business in those places. By learning how to count in Spanish and French, you can improve your communication skills and enhance your overall knowledge of these important languages."

She wakes up, and surveys her surroundings purposefully - in search of a morning cigarette. Making do with a glass of scotch instead, she meanders through the apartment, brushing her teeth, washing her face, going through a closet and trying on a mink coat for size. As she goes to into the living room, she finds her dress torn on the floor. With a sigh, she heads toward her purse on the table, and finds a note for her with some cash. \"Gloria - I hope $250.00 is enough. -L\"Anger washes over her face, as she reels away from the note. Lipstick in hand, she scrawls \"No Sale\" on a large mirror in the living room, and leaves the cash on the mantle. She leaves a few dollars next to the scotch bottle to pay for her drink, and leaves the posh apartment in only her slip and the fur coat.After hailing a taxi to a more middle-class area, she knocks on the door of her friend, Steve Carpenter, a composer. At his piano, he makes sarcastic comments as Gloria parades around the apartment. She takes off the coat and teases him - he quietly tenses and commands her to put the coat back on. Gloria persists in teasing him, flirting with him, until she sees that he is being very serious. She puts on the coat, and is about to leave - making sure to proclaim that he is \"the only person [she] can be honest with.\" He replies back that he wishes she wouldn't - he doesn't want to have to see her throw away her life like this. After making to leave - he finally calls her back. Both forgiving, he makes coffee and breakfast for both of them. She coyly says that she'll need something to wear home, and that her mother will be appalled if she goes home dressed - or rather undressed - like that.

The reporter indicates that Sarah was an activist from Chicago involved in helping refugees from the Chilean government and that her death may cast new light on the movement. Fielding is completely distraught over hearing this news and the movie begins.The first 3/4 of the movie unfolds on parallel timelines in the 70s and early 80s: the progression of Fielding & Sarah's complicated, volatile relationship and Fielding's ascension into power as an upcoming politician dealing with the recent loss (and haunting memories) of Sarah.Fielding meets Sarah as he is returning, in uniform, from duty in the Coast Guard and meeting up with his brother, who is a editor. The brother, Fielding and Sarah all go to lunch where Fielding is very ouspoken in his political ideals about current events. Sarah and Fielding are both immediately intrigued by each other, Fielding's attraction being more sexual and blatant and Sarah's attraction more of curiousity and intrigue. A few dates quickly lead to a sexual relationship despite an obvious difference in political thinking between the two. Sarah asks why Fielding wants to be a senator and his very serious reply is that he doesn't- he wants to be president. Sarah is later quoted as saying \"Ambition is the ice in the lake of emotion.\" And when Fielding tries to comfort Sarah's fear of his Coast Guard duty leading to a Vietnam tour, she replies \"but if you go over there, you'll be shooting at the guys that I want to win.\" Their intense love outweighs their differences, though, and their relationship quickly becomes serious.Meanwhile Fielding is a young politician being groomed to be congressman by the current govenor because of a scandal involving Jerry Carmichael 's (Ed Harris in a cameo role) resignation due to his homosexuality.

At close quarters in that wet place, the men on whom the camera closes in are attacking one another with bayonets, swords, fists, or even by holding an enemy's face in the mud to drown him. Many of the combatants are black. A voice-over says that the rebels (Confederates, or rebs) \"killed every negro soldier they captured at Poison Springs... so at Jenkins Ferry, we decided we weren't taking no reb prisoners.\" The camera cuts to show the speaker, a black soldier in an army camp talking to someone who after a few seconds is revealed to be President Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis). The soldier (Private Harold Green, Colman Domingo) and his comrade (Corporal Ira Clark, David Oyelowo) tell Lincoln their names, ranks, and where they're headed next (Wilmington). They're pleased that they're finally being paid as much as the white soldiers, but Clark complains about the lack of commissioned negro officers and sarcastically predicts that whites might be able to tolerate a negro colonel in 50 years -- and \"in 100 years, the vote.\" A couple of white soldiers who heard Lincoln speak at Gettysburg come up; one repeats the beginning of the Gettysburg address and his friend recites the next lines. They're called away, but Corporal Clark finishes the speech as he walks off.In January 1865, the recently reëlected Lincoln notes the imminence of the Civil War's end, wondering out loud what will become of the former slaves. He finds insufficiency, even hypocrisy, in his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which had freed most slaves as a war measure but had not made slavery illegal. Only a constitutional amendment illegalizing slavery, he realizes, will spell its permanent end in America.Debate rages even within his own cabinet, but as Lincoln sees it, the passage of the constitutional amendment cannot wait until the end of the war, for Southern slaves who had been freed as a war measure might fall into forced servitude once again.

(September 2014)Four young adults â David (Connell), Susan (Hewitt), Jim (Bonner) and Jim's girlfriend, Vicki (Robin Christopher) â head into the woods to look for a lost scientist, Dr. Arthur Waterman (Leiber). The friends have a picnic and glimpse a mysterious castle in the woods. They find that Dr. Waterman's cabin seems to have been destroyed. A forest ranger (Woods), who is Asmodeus in human form, watches over the teenagers. When the group stumbles into a cave, a strange old man (Irving L. Lichtenstein) presents them with an ancient book filled with magical lore and symbols. Asmodeus sends monsters â a giant ape-like creature and a green-skinned, fur-clad giant (Jim Duron) â to retrieve the book from them at all costs. The ape-like creature kills the old man. The castle seems to have disappeared, however the friends discover that it has been rendered invisible by magic.After killing Jim, Asmodeus reveals his true form, that of a winged red demon. Asmodeus kills Jim's girlfriend and then attacks Dave and Susan. Dave and Susan flee to a cemetery and destroy the demon with a cross. As it dies, the cemetery explodes, killing Susan. Dave sees a shadowy giant who prophesies that Dave will be dead in one year and one day. Dave loses his sanity, and is confined to a mental hospital. One year and one day later, an evil-faced Susan arrives at the hospital to visit him.The film concludes with end credits saying \"The End?\" leaving the audience to wonder if the story will ever continue and if Susan is still possessed by Asmodeus."

At other times, he says this is simply a song cycle depicting two young lovers swallowed up in a cold city.\n\nTurns out he was being pretty straight: Thematically and musically, Mylo Xyloto does come across as a medium-weight and up-to-date blend of middle-period U2, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and Coldplay's last three albums. Co-producer Brian Eno, who oversaw 2008's Grammy-winning Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, returns and adds some faintly exotic Middle Eastern and electro-pop sounds and even a danceable rhythm or two.\n\nMartin strikes a lightly defiant tone early on in Hurts Like Heaven when, against a surging beat, he sings, \"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine/Tonight the streets are ours/And we're writing and saying/Don't let 'em take control.'' And he warns in Major Minus that \"they got one eye watching you … so be careful who it is you're talking to.''\n\nBut that's about as deep as the songs probe, politically.\n\nThe remainder deal with escapism and tormented romance. First single Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall celebrates taking refuge in music, while in second single Paradise, a young woman finds her release by dreaming.\n\nThose tracks and Hurts Like Heaven showcase what the band does best: using seductive, soaring melodies as platforms for Martin's earnest vocals (his falsetto is gorgeous here) and swelling keyboards, Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar, and anthemic \"whoa oh-oh\" choruses.\n\nThe breakup songs are less engaging, save Princess of China, in which Rihanna, in a heartfelt been-there performance, laments, \"Once upon a time we burned bright/Now all we ever seem to do is fight/On and on, and on and on and on.''\n\nMartin and mates aren't ones to send listeners away feeling put-upon, so they wrap things up with the reassuring (and precious) Up With the Birds, which predicts that \"Good things are coming our way.\"\n\n>Download:Paradise, Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall, Hurts Like Heaven, Princess of China",

        "input": "",
        "output": "If Kenneth bought 700oz of fabric at $40 per oz, he spent a total of 700 * 40 = $28000. Nicholas bought six times as much fabric as Kenneth, meaning Nicholas bought 6 * 700 = 4200oz of fabric. If an oz of fabric is sold at $40, Nicholas paid 4200 * $40 = $168000 for the 4200oz of fabric. The amount of money that Nicholas paid more than Kenneth for the fabric he bought is $168000 - 28000 = $140000. So the final answer is 140000."
